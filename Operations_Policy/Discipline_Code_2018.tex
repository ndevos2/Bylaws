\section{Discipline Code}\label{policy: code of conduct}

\subsection{Introduction and Purpose}
\begin{enumerate} [align=left]
\item  The purpose of the Society's Discipline Code is to define the general standard of conduct expected of members of the Society of Graduate Students (henceforth known as the Society), provide examples of behaviour that constitutes a breach of this standard of conduct and set out the disciplinary procedures that the Society will follow.
\item The Society is a community of graduate student members involved in learning, teaching, research, and other activities. The Society provides an environment of free and creative inquiry within which critical thinking, mutual respect, and practical skills are cultivated and sustained. It is committed to a mission and to principles that will foster excellence and create an environment where its students and staff can grow and flourish.
\item Members assume the rights and responsibilities associated with membership in the Society's academic and social community. The privileges granted to each member are conditional upon the fulfilment of this responsibility and members must familiarize themselves with Society regulations and the conduct expected of them while studying at Western University.
\item Members are reminded that they are equally responsible for observing the standard of conduct set out in this Code when using any electronic devices to send or post messages or material.
\item The Society encourages informal resolution of minor incidents.
\item Nothing in this Discipline Code shall be construed to prohibit peaceful assemblies and demonstrations, lawful picketing, or to inhibit free speech as guaranteed by law.
\item Any member found responsible for misconduct is subject to the Society's disciplinary sanctions, regardless of the action or inaction of civil authorities. Nothing in this Code precludes the Society from referring an individual matter to Western University or an appropriate law enforcement agency either before, during, or after disciplinary action is taken by the Society under this Code. A member may be subject to criminal prosecution and/or civil proceedings notwithstanding, and in addition to, disciplinary action taken by the Society against the member under this Code.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Interim Measures}
\begin{enumerate} [align=left]
\item Temporary Exclusions.

Such initial exclusion shall last for the duration of the meeting. The Official Liaison shall report the exclusion immediately to the Ombudsperson.
\item Interim Prohibition. The Ombudsperson may impose an interim prohibition pending an investigation and disposition of a complaint of misconduct. Interim prohibition may be imposed only:

Within two (2) working days following the imposition of interim prohibition, the member shall be informed in writing of the reasons for the prohibition. The member shall be afforded the opportunity to respond to the allegations being made against them. If the member responds, the Ombudsperson will reassess the prohibition and either revoke or continue the prohibition pending formal disposition of the matter.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Complaint Procedures}
\begin{enumerate} [align=left]
\item Any member(s) or employee(s) may submit a complaint of misconduct against any member(s). A complaint should be submitted to the Society's Ombudsperson.
\item The Ombudsperson shall not make a finding of misconduct nor impose a sanction or sanctions against a member unless the member has been informed, in writing, of the nature of the complaint, the facts alleged against them, and has been given a reasonable opportunity to respond and to submit relevant information. The member shall also be given a reasonable opportunity to meet personally with the Ombudsperson to discuss the matter. It is the responsibility of both parties to provide all materials and information that will support their positions. Furthermore, the Ombudsperson will make reasonable attempts to ascertain the truth to the best of their ability.
\begin{enumerate} [label*=\arabic*., align=left]
\item If the Ombudsperson feels that they are not in a position to fairly rule on a complaint due to conflict of interest or must recuse themselves for any reason, they can forward the complaint to a member of the Appeals Review Commission (ARC), chosen at random, by the Speaker, to act as the Ombudsperson for this matter only.
\end{enumerate}
\item If the Ombudsperson concludes that there has been misconduct, the Ombudsperson may impose an appropriate sanction or sanctions.
\item If the member does not respond to the allegation or does not meet with the Ombudsperson after having been given a reasonable opportunity to do so, the Ombudsperson may proceed to dispose of the complaint without such a response or meeting.
\item At all meetings with the Ombudsperson, both parties may be accompanied by a colleague of their choosing. Legal representation is not permitted at this stage; it is only permitted at the appeal stage. \item In determining an appropriate sanction or sanctions, the Ombudsperson may take into account any previous findings of misconduct. The Ombudsperson may direct that a sanction be held in abeyance if a member's registration at the University is interrupted for any reason.
\item The decision of the Ombudsperson, with reasons, shall be communicated in writing (electronic media are acceptable) to the member. If there is a finding of misconduct, a copy of the decision will be retained in the Society's Administrative Office. A copy of the decision shall be provided on a need-to- know basis to administrative units (e.g. Executive Officers and Non-Executive Officers). The Speaker and the relevant Executive is responsible for the implementation of any decision made under the Code.
\item All notices and other communications from the Ombudsperson to the member in question or any other member of the University community shall be by personal delivery, campus mail, e-mail, priority post, courier, or registered mail.
